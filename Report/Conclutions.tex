\section{Conclusions}

Following the controllability analysis performed it can be stated that

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The process contains good controllability characteristics. The bandwidth limitations on the process are reasonable, and will allow for the implementation of a controller.
	\item The bounds set on disturbance variation were too ambitious, and the process may not be able to reject disturbances with magnitude close to the upper or lower bounds.
	\item The bounds set on maximum set-point variation also appeared to be too ambitious. Especially the maximum set-point variation of 8~$\celsius$ on the bottom tray temperature will not be realizable in the system.
	\item The unstable nodes in the MIMO system were calculated and analysed successfully.
	\item An acceptable uncertainty model was constructed to describe the various uncertainties within the model.
	\item A performance weight was constructed to measure the nominal and robust performance of the process once the controller design has begun.
\end{enumerate}

Recommendations and processes that will have to follow are

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The controller for the process will have to be designed, using various methods (decentralized, $H^\infty$-design).
	\item When a controller transfer function has been designed, the nominal and robust stability and performance of the process has to be verified.
	\item After the analysis and design, the implementation of the controller can commence.
\end{enumerate}
